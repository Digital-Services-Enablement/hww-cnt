            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>Integrated Strategic Planning (ISP) identifies current issues and addresses future organizational or team needs. It is a detailed plan to establish key strategic priorities based on integrated inputs from stakeholders (ie: branches) within
                your organization. Some of the key aspects of preparing your plan require the assembly of an integrated planning team with clearly defined roles, a schedule to stay on track, and a medium to obtain the necessary inputs, such as a weekly
                meeting.
              </p>
              <p>It begins by assessing your team&rsquo;s/or organization&rsquo;s position by identifying issues, risks, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.</p>
              <p>The next step is to identify all stakeholders who will be included in this joint planning exercise and to organize a collaborative planning session(s). This session(s) will facilitate the communication of necessary and available resources
                commitments that will influence your strategic goals.</p>
              <p>Based on the above inputs, you will then need to formulate your integrated strategic objectives. This is the crux of this play and a result of your hard work carried out above.</p>
              <p>Be sure to present the final version of this plan with all those involved to ensure that feedback is considered, and any necessary amendments are made to your objectives.</p>

              <p>Now that you have a rough plan, complete an assessment of your team&rsquo;s&nbsp;strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) prior to establishing who will comprise your integrated planning team.</p>
              <p>Complete page 2 &ndash;&nbsp;SWOT&nbsp;analysis&nbsp;&ndash; of the <a href="/hww-cnt/incl/integratedplanningtool.docx">integrated planning tool</a> to assess your team&rsquo;s position.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Consider the&nbsp;following when completing your&nbsp;SWOT table:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>What are some your team&rsquo;s challenges, and what factors contribute to these challenges?</li>

                <li>What external factors does your team have no control over? These could be things such as budget cuts or policy changes.</li>

                <p>Aim to produce no more than five key integrated planning objectives – should you establish more than five, prioritize your issues by order of significance. Your planning team may identify other issues that you did not consider that may

                <p>Ensure that representatives from the necessary levels of management are included on the team. Your ISP objectives should always align with the overall Department’s objectives. Having senior management at the planning session ensures this
                  alignment and can potentially eliminate ineffective objectives.</p>
                <p>Also consider the various branches within your organization as well as external stakeholders that you may communicate with. Have you thought about corporate services (human and financial resources), IT, facilities management, programs,
                  policy, issues management, transformation, etc.? </p>
