So, saying “agile” on its own can be unspecific when used to summarize all the many aspects of agile. Often, non-software teams practicing “agile” go through a process of adapting the principles and values to their context. It’s important to understand what aspects of “agile” a team or organization is committing too. <br /><b>Agile vs Scrum</b><br />Agile and scrum are different things.

Therefore, they used a research practice from ethnography called immersion. This enabled the researchers to immerse themselves in the recreational drone world, and become drone pilots themselves.

                    <td>Human-centred design aims to create empathy between the various stakeholders. Having stakeholders feel the frustration of unmet needs can cause teams to get the support they need to address the problem. There are many ways to cultivate empathy in the design process. For example, personas, or watching videos of users performing problematic tasks in a usability study. <br />Don't emotions get in the way of decision-making? The ultimate goal is not for designers to evoke emotional responses to base decisions on alone. The goal is to bring the user’s experience into the decision-making equation, as it’s often not included. Good strategy balances user's needs, business needs, and technical feasibility. This often leads to compromises. Having an understanding of how users think, feel, and use your solution can guide responsible, low-risk compromises. How much you compromise on user needs influences business results. So the processes of measuring and learning from the approach is paramount for finding the right balance.</td>

These needs are defined by empirical evidence into behaviours and emotions. <br />It all comes down to the fact that humans act in irrational, illogical ways. What people think they do, say they do, and what they actually do are often different. So to effectively solve problems for humans, we need to understand their behaviours and experiences. This is why much of user research is “boots on the ground”, observing and experiencing with people. This contrasts current approaches in business research. Many tactics only collect what people think. Examples of this are Public Opinion Research, focus groups, and interviews.</td>

They would document both the site survey and their experience doing it. Then we gave their site surveys to a Transport Canada inspector.

                      This example comes from a great case study by Jarod Spool about an insurance company. They wanted to save the company money by having customers take their photos for insurance claims instead of a professional. Instead of building an entire platform to learn if it could be done, they broke the idea into questions. The first question was, could they get customer-supplied pictures that would be good enough for the claims adjusters? To answer this question, they recruited a handful of claims agents to help with an experiment. When those agents would get a call from a customer opening a new damage claim, they’d ask that customer to send in some photos. They were able to learn that they would need to provide support to the customer to take better pictures. They kept iterating on their instructions until the photos were of adequate quality, proving it was a viable solution.<br /><a href="https://medium.com/@jmspool/avoiding-the-wrong-mvp-approach-65fe3e5c5c28">Avoiding the Wrong MVP Approach - Jarod Spool</a>

The profile format provides a quick reference to all the aspects a designer considers in the design. Because of this, it can support alignment with project teams and stakeholders. Personas often include a user's motivations, frustrations, and scenarios of use. <br />To note, you may see personas at the centre of debates. Many have identified that there are several ways in which personas can fail to serve their purpose. Further, a poorly executed persona can have negative unintended consequences. For example, too much focus on demographics can perpetuate stereotypes and other biases. These risks can be seen greater than the benefit of the tool. <br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unXNy4MMRD3aHk4o5SlpsXK4yPDDkmabTr9bP8Dnkbo/edit?usp=sharing">Here’s a two-pager created by the Transport Canada Service Innovation Centre of Excellence on the opportunities and risks of using personas.</a></td>

They need support and guidance from Transport Canada as the regulator of this environment. These people aren’t traditional aviation clients that the department is used to interfacing with, for example, AirCanada, whose business depends entirely on compliance. If Transport Canada wants voluntary compliance, the process will need to seem manageable for these everyday people. This means addressing how Transport Canada supports users in following the regulations. <br />The Digital Drone Collective will need to start small to learn about how we might tackle regulation guidance with a digital tool in order to bring it to scale. To do this, we are going to investigate how we can best facilitate the learning of the most challenging part of the regulations, the site survey. Through this, we can learn how we might apply this approach to other aspects of the regulation. We will investigate how we guide users through the process, have them understand why, and when they’ve achieved success. Through this, we can grow motivation, help people understand the information, and give guidance on how to comply with regulations.”</td>

                      Prototyping is an essential practice in agile, human-centred, and lean practices. It takes ideas and makes them “real” to learn and continue developing. <br /> Describing the fidelity of a prototype is helpful for viewers to know the purpose of it. We often describe fidelity as the following:
                      <ul>
                        <li><b>High-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype: </b>looks and functions as close to the real product as possible.</li>
                        <li><b>Mid-fidelity (mid-fi) prototype: </b>simulates all functionality. It only includes the visual detail necessary to test usability.</li>
                        <li><b>Low-fidelity (low-fi) prototype: </b>simulates early versions of functionality and workflow. This enables us to test direction early in the design process.</li>
