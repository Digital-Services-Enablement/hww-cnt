So, saying “agile” on its own can be unspecific when used to summarize all the many aspects of agile. Often, non-software teams practicing “agile” go through a process of adapting the principles and values to their context. It’s important to understand what aspects of “agile” a team or organization is committing too. <br /><b>Agile vs Scrum</b><br />Agile and scrum are different things.

Therefore, they used a research practice from ethnography called immersion. This enabled the researchers to immerse themselves in the recreational drone world, and become drone pilots themselves. They would be some of the first users of the Drone Portal and use their experience to map an initial experience journey to compliance. - <a href="https://medium.com/@andeepittman/immersion-a-winning-tactic-for-empathy-and-journey-mapping-b938a9b40e2a">“Immersion--A winning tactic for empathy and journey mapping in government”</a></li>

In this instance, the new policy had many new requirements and services, which meant the potential problem space was also large. <br />The team also needed to be creative in user research. There weren't any users to learn from because the project had started before the new regulations were released.  Instead, they used an ethnographic research method called immersion to become drone pilots and study themselves. This type of study was in-depth, and also added time to the discovery phase.
