<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="before">What to do before meetings that leads to increased productivity</span></h2>
<h4>Make sure the team is familiar and comfortable with the software used</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Ensuring team members are trained in the soft wares and programs being used helps reduce issues when connecting</li>
</ul>

<h4>Provide sufficient time before meetings</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Starting meetings 5 minutes later (e.g. 11:05am rather than 11:00am) allows employees a 5 minutes break between meetings to step away to get coffee/water, use the restrooms and allows time to prep for the next meeting.</li>
    <li>Having a predetermined timeslot each week for regular meetings is a good way to ensure the team will be prepared for the meeting.</li>
    <li>Spontaneous or sudden meeting invites may lead to team members being underprepared for the meeting as they had not been given time to plan for it. They likely will not have any time to clear up any roadblocks in the tasks they are working on and might not be able to provide detailed information on the work’s progression</li>
</ul>

<h4>Provide important documents and background information prior to the meeting, as well as informing team members of the objectives and purpose of the meeting. </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Including the reading or debrief material prior to the meeting (in the meeting invitations) will lead to the team members being more prepared, as well as giving them the ability to prepare the documents they need in order to meet objectives.</li>
    <li>Less time will be spent in the meeting explaining concepts and projects, and more time can be spent in engagement discussions and working progressively.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Set yourself up for success by creating a meeting environment with no distractions or setbacks.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>If a meeting is planned on your calendar ahead of time, make sure your device battery is fully charged and ready to last the meeting.</li>
    <li>Call into the meeting from a quiet workspace, with minimal background distractions - meetings will be more productive when the discussion can be focused on work rather than being hampered by background noise. </li>
    <p>     **Don’t forget that working from home can be a challenging and stressful time for some, and certain factors such as having children needing attention at some point will occur. Be mindful of your team member’s needs and be tolerant of certain minor setbacks during meetings.</p>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="during"></span>Things you can do during meetings to maximize productivity within the team and ensure efficient virtual meetings</span></h2>

<h4>Organize and structure the meeting properly, by starting with describing the meeting agenda and setting clear goals and objectives you seek to accomplish during the meeting. </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Letting everyone know how the meeting will be conducted, as well as introducing a few ground rules, can allow team members to gather all the information they need and be ready for when they are called upon to speak or want to give their input.</li> 
</ul>

<h4>Seek to create a working environment high in engagement from all parties.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Having visuals while you are talking creates a more engaging listening experience as well as providing additional clarity to those less familiar with a project or initiative.</l1>
    <li>Leading discussions requiring and encouraging team members’ input will lead to more productive discussions and increase feedback, as well as keeping everyone interested and engaged in the content.</li>
    <li>Presenting case studies/stories supporting your initiative can keep the presentation engaging, especially when the presented content is relevant to the work you are doing and inspires team members.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Having your camera ON is a small action that can make a world of difference</h4>
<ul>
    <li>In order to recreate a similar environment to in-person meetings, face to face contact and discussions are crucial in making the virtual meeting have a collaborative feel.</l1>
    <li>Talking to a blank screen can be a bit uncomfortable to some and make it seem like team member’s engagement is reduced.</li>
    <li>Facial expressions and body language are an important part of communication and fostering connections, as well as interpreting feedback. Video chats may lead to the team feeling more close-knit and progressing on issues more productively.</li>
    <li>Be mindful toward your team members. Some may prefer audio chats only and may not wish to turn on their camera, so try not to pressure them too much. Rather, focus on encouraging everyone that is comfortable to use the video chat feature.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Provide all the tools available to promote productive meetings and elevate the content and clarity of the meetings.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Use the built-in features certain softwares may have such as screen-sharing, breakout rooms to divide into smaller groups to discuss certain points.</li>
    <p>This may help integrate content more efficiently and increase collaboration within the team.</p>
</ul>

<h4>Use a facilitator to help keep the meeting smooth and on-track, minimizing time lost on misunderstandings and off-topic discussions.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Having a team member keeping everyone on track in regards of the meeting objectives will allow for structured meetings.</li>
    <li>A facilitator can control who has the floor for certain portions of the meeting and allows for someone to present all their information with minimal interruptions.</li>
    <li>Having someone on the team taking meeting notes or highlights during the meeting can also be a good idea for increasing meeting productivity. If a team member recalls an issue brought up during the meeting and wants to read more about it, the notes are a helpful tool to look back to.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Staying focused on the meeting goal and avoiding side-tracked discussions and topics can be a great way to keep the meeting productive as well as keeping everyone comfortable.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Switching the subject away from the original meeting purpose and seeking an answer to other objectives can lead to the meeting failing to accomplish its expectations. Avoid blindsiding other team members by asking for information they may not have yet prepared or is still in process.</li>
    <li>Recurrent meetings will be much more productive and smooth sailing if everyone is comfortable and familiar with the structure, and knowing what to expect.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="after"></span> Measures can also be taken after meetings in order to build on and improve future meetings</span></h2>

<h4>Having time set aside at the end of meetings for feedback and questions from the team is a great way to clear up any misunderstandings and improve future meetings.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Take the time to listen to what the rest of the team says, and to understand things from different perspectives.</li>
    <li>If the team has concerns about certain things, it is much more efficient to clear them up before progressive further on a project.</li>
    <li>Share notes/minutes with your team members – one person might have missed something themselves, therefore sharing notes ensures that all team members are on the same page</li>
</ul>
