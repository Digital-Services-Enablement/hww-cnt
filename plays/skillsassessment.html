          <p><strong>Use this play to...</strong></p>
          <p>Use this play to identify gaps, forecast future HR needs, and help your team gain beneficial skills. Your team will appreciate the learning opportunities while your users will appreciate the improved performance. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Assess your team’s strengths and weaknesses </li>
            <li>Determine training needs </li>

              <p>Does your team have the right balance of competencies* to meet your priorities, objectives or even that new initiative you were just tasked with? You probably have a decent understanding of your team’s strengths, weaknesses, and what each
                member brings to the table. Have you taken the time to dissect your team members’ abilities? Have you considered some of the challenges that your team members may face? </p>
              <p>This play helps you and your team succeed by assessing the balance of personalities on your team and identifying team areas for improvement. You will then proceed to create a competency map that visualizes your team’s strengths and weaknesses.
                Your team will then conduct a gap analysis to identify competencies needed to improve your team. </p>
              <p>This is then followed by providing opportunities for members to express interest in those identified gaps in order to learn new skills or improve weaknesses. </p>
              <p>The last portion will enable you to craft team member learning plans or develop an HR plan to obtain the missing competencies. The return on this investment in your team will be invaluable and reflected in your team’s performance, sense
                of belonging, and effectiveness. </p>
              <p>* For the purpose of this play, competencies include knowledge, skills, abilities, personal qualities, values and traits. </p>

          <p>Set aside a morning or afternoon with your entire team since you and your team will be required to self-assess. Begin by having your team determine if you have the optimum balance of personality types by completing page 1, “Team roles assessment”,
            of the <a href="/hww-cnt/incl/skillsandcompetencies.docx">planning tool</a>. Personalities that are missing a match may become areas where you are seeking to improve. Then complete the table by having each employee identify competencies and
            related strengths and weaknesses they may possess (based on the personalities). </p>

            <p>To help your team brainstorm additional strengths and weaknesses you can refer the following <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/staffing-assessment-tools-resources/human-resources-specialists-hiring-managers/management-toolkit/competencies.html">list of competencies</a>]
              from the Public Service Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can also call your HR advisor to enquire about the generic job descriptions relevant to your team. This may help you gain a better understanding of the competencies that your team should already possess or may be missing.&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Use the template “Competency map” on page 2 of the <a href="/hww-cnt/incl/skillsandcompetencies.docx">planning tool</a> to organize your team’s competency assessment from page 1 to create a visually pleasing chart (one map per employee). This
            is useful for determining areas that may require improvement. It is also a great tool for employees to identify missing skills. </p>
          <p>Note that the Likert scale ranges from 0 (no understanding) to 4 (expert) and the chart allows for up to 8 competencies of your choosing. You can easily add more competencies by drawing lines through the circle as necessary. </p>

      <h2>Gap analysis </h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Now that you have a visual representation of your team’s strengths and weaknesses, conduct a gap analysis by contrasting those competencies required to complete your team’s objectives versus your team’s skills inventory. As a team, complete
            page 3, “Gap analysis”, of the <a href="/hww-cnt/incl/skillsandcompetencies.docx">planning tool</a> to establish a list of missing competencies and areas requiring improvement (don’t forget to refer to the competency maps from step 2). The
            resulting list will serve as your primary guidance in identifying and prioritizing your competencies wish list. </p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>You can now strategize which team members will acquire the skills necessary to be successful in achieving the team’s goals. Start by filling in the first column of the table, “Acquiring competencies plan”, on page 4 of the <a href="/hww-cnt/incl/skillsandcompetencies.docx">planning tool</a>            with the missing competencies column from the gap analysis (page 3). As a team, complete the rest of the columns by brainstorming what can be done to acquire the missing competencies, identifying and researching potential opportunities and
            finally determine which team member will do what. </p>
          <p>Voilà! you now have personalized competencies plan for each team member that will develop your employees and allow your team to achieve its goals and objectives. </p>
          <p>It’s a win-win – by completing the competencies planning activity as a team it shows them that the organization is serious about investing in relevant learning that is mutually beneficial. </p>
