            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>Does your team have the right balance of competencies* to meet your priorities, objectives or the new initiative you were just tasked with? You probably have a decent understanding of your team’s strengths, weaknesses, and what each member brings to the table but have you taken the time to dissect your team members’ overall abilities? 
                 This play helps you and your team succeed by assessing your balance of competencies. You can use the results to gain insight into those weaker competencies that may require improvement. Additionally, team members can use the optional competency map to assess and evaluate their own personal balance of competencies. 
                 The results can be used to help develop individual learning plans, as well as prioritize the acquisition of competencies based on the team’s objectives. The return on this investment in your team will be invaluable and reflected in your team’s performance, sense of belonging and effectiveness. 
                 * For the purpose of this play, competencies represents knowledge, skills, abilities, personal qualities, values and traits. </p>
              <p>This play helps you and your team succeed by assessing the balance of personalities on your team and identifying team areas for improvement. You will then proceed to create a competency map that visualizes your team’s strengths and weaknesses.
                Your team will then conduct a gap analysis to identify competencies needed to improve your team. </p>
              <p>This is then followed by providing opportunities for members to express interest in those identified gaps in order to learn new skills or improve weaknesses. </p>
              <p>The last portion will enable you to craft team member learning plans or develop an HR plan to obtain the missing competencies. The return on this investment in your team will be invaluable and reflected in your team’s performance, sense
                of belonging, and effectiveness. </p>
              <p>* For the purpose of this play, competencies include knowledge, skills, abilities, personal qualities, values and traits. </p>

          <li>Using a collaborative online tool such as MS Teams share the self-assessment excel document (Annex A) with your team</li>

           <li>In the master tab add your team’s goals/objectives, and decide which skills are relevant by answer yes or no under the aligned with team goals.</li>
           <li>When your team has completed their individual tabs, your master worksheet will automatically update all your scores. From these results you can sort you skills by those aligned with team goals, from weakest to strongest or vice versa.</li>
           </ol>
           <p>You have now completed your team’s competency needs assessment and have a customized list identifying your team’s strengths and weaknesses. Consider improving those weaknesses that will help your team achieve your goals.</p>

          <p>Use the template “Competency map” on page 2 of the <a href="/hww-cnt/incl/skillsandcompetencies.docx">planning tool</a> to organize your team’s competency assessment from page 1 to create a visually pleasing chart (one map per employee). This
            is useful for determining areas that may require improvement. It is also a great tool for employees to identify missing skills. </p>
          <p>Note that the Likert scale ranges from 0 (no understanding) to 4 (expert) and the chart allows for up to 8 competencies of your choosing. You can easily add more competencies by drawing lines through the circle as necessary. </p>

            page 3, “Gap analysis”, of the <a href="/hww-cnt/incl/skillsandcompetencies.docx">planning tool</a> to establish a list of missing competencies and areas requiring improvement (don’t forget to refer to the competency maps from step 2). The
