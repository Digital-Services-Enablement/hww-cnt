        <h2>Use this to play to:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Engage with and get to know your team</li>
	<li>Create a team culture while managing a remote team</li>
	<li>Help address the need for social interactions</li>
	<li>Help to build a strong, productive and engaged remote team</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the play:</h2>
<p><i>The purpose of this play is to help managers build close knit teams while working remotely and to help encourage digital, social interactions. </i></p>
<p>COVID-19 has brought forth new challenges therefore integrating some of these Plays can help to create fun, social interactions within teams to help support the wellbeing of employees and address social isolation. It is key to remember, <i>"You are not working from home, you are at home during a pandemic, trying to work"</i>.</p>
<p>Below you will find tips, tricks and tools to promote social interactions for your team. Prior to these activities, assess the needs and reality of your team members and apply activities that fit those needs.</p>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p><strong>MS Teams: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/private-channels">Build Channels</a></strong> on Teams to allow for focused communications within your team.</p>
<p>Incorporate <strong><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/standups">Stand-Up</a></strong> meetings (as many as required per week, depending on the needs of your team) - Using <a href="https://www.polly.ai/agile-polly-for-microsoft-teams">AgilePolly</a> (subscription required) or set a channel for this action. (NOTE - Interface in English only, however questions can be asked in French)</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/rollercoaster-check-in?utm_source=sendinblue&utm_campaign=newsletter20200624&utm_medium=email">Roller-coaster check-in</a></strong> at the beginning of your meetings to open a space to talk about where team members are at in their work and in their personal lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of key questions you can ask:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
	<li>How are you doing (managing work/life)?</li>
	<li>Is there anything you need to bring forward to your Manager / Director?</li>
	<li>What obstacles or challenges are you dealing with?</li>
</ul>
<p>This will give you, as a manager, insight into everyone's day.  As this would be visible by your whole team, managers should communicate to their teams that if they don't feel comfortable sharing their obstacles or struggles in a group setting, this can be done privately, thus the importance of one-on-one meetings as well.</p>
<p>To celebrate a team member's milestone event (i.e., birthdays, anniversaries, retirements, promotions, etc.) use the record option in MS Teams Meetings to capture a special message Tip: try adding a fun background in the video message!</p>
<p>Host weekly team meetings. Consider incorporating a theme that can be decided by the team at the end of each meeting if all are comfortable in doing so.  These are a nice way to break the ice at the beginning of your meetings. Some possible themes could be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Show your Canadian Pride - Wear the Flag, your hockey jersey, have a full <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/06/26/canadian-tuxedo_n_5533926.html?guccounter=1">Canadian Tuxedo</a>.</li>
	<li>Pick your favorite movie</li>
	<li>General theme (e.g. 80's, 90s)</li>
	<li>Puppets - Have you ever wished you were on Fraggle Rock? Here's your chance - Check out what a team at TC did <a href="https://twitter.com/Copeland309/status/1283810078026600448">here</a>!</li>
	<li>Celebrity dress up - Channel your inner Celeb</li>
	<li>Crazy hair/hat day</li>
	<li>Bring your pet or kid "to work" day - where your new co-worker(s) joins in on the meeting.</li>
	<li>Celebrate culture and diversity - have team members show their culture pride.</li>
</ul>
<p>* Remember you can hide or change your background in Teams to match your themes.</p>
<p>TC Transformation backgrounds can be found <a href="https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Transport_Canada/TCTrans/msback">here</a>.  *</p>
