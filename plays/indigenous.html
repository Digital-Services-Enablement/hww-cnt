      <h2>History and reconciliation </h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Indigenous peoples have lived on the land we now call Canada for thousands of years, with their own unique cultures, identities, traditions, languages and institutions.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>There are more than 600 First Nations communities, 50 Inuit communities in Inuit&nbsp;Nunangat&nbsp;(Inuvialuit, Nunavut, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut), and approximately 400,000 people identifying as M&eacute;tis in Canada.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Early partnerships between Indigenous nations and colonial governments were forged through treaties as well as trade and military alliances and were based on mutual respect and co-operation. Over many centuries, these relationships were eroded
            by colonial policies that were made into laws.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Treaties provide a framework for living together and sharing the land Indigenous peoples traditionally occupied. These agreements provide foundations for ongoing co-operation and partnership as we move forward together to advance reconciliation.
            Canada recognizes 70 historic treaties and 54 Modern Treaties across the country, with 30 modern treaty negotiations underway.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Canada has embarked on a journey of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. It is a necessary journey to address the scars left by a long history of colonialism.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Much of Canada&rsquo;s transportation infrastructure is within or close to the traditional territories of Indigenous peoples, including:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Many of the 23 airports under the National Airports System and 18 small airports owned by Transport Canada;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The 17 ports independently managed by Canada Port Authorities and 44 port facilities currently owned and operated by Transport Canada; and,&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The national rail system,&nbsp;comprised of over 40,000 kilometers of track.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In recent years, Transport Canada&rsquo;s work with Indigenous peoples has evolved significantly and the department continues to adapt its activities in response to these changes. New direction from the Courts, government announcements and agreements
            have created new obligations which will continue to frame Transport Canada&rsquo;s business into the future with wide ranging implications across all modes of transportation.&nbsp;</p>
