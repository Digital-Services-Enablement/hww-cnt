                  <p>Treaties are agreements made between the Government of Canada, Indigenous groups and often provinces and territories that define ongoing rights and obligations on all sides as it relates to land.</p>
                  <p>These agreements set out continuing treaty rights and benefits for each group. Treaty rights and Aboriginal rights (commonly referred to as Indigenous rights) are recognized and affirmed in Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and are also a key part of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which the Government of Canada has committed to adopt.</p>
                  <p>Treaties with Indigenous peoples include both:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>historic treaties with First Nations, and;</li>

                  <div class="row">
                     <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>The modern treaty era began in 1973 after the Supreme Court of Canada decision (Calder et al. v. Attorney-General of British Columbia), which recognized Aboriginal rights for the first time. This decision led to the development of the Comprehensive Land Claims Policy and the first modern treaty, the James Bay and Northern Qu&eacute;bec Agreement signed in 1975.</p>
                        <p>Since 1975, Canada has signed 25 additional treaties (called modern treaties or comprehensive land claim agreements) with Indigenous groups in Canada. Some of these treaties include self-government.</p>
                        <p>These treaties are the basis of the relationship between 97 Indigenous communities (representing about 89,000 Indigenous peoples) and the provincial or territorial and federal governments.</p>
                        <p>As part of modern treaty negotiations, joint work is done to lay the groundwork for moving forward together after a final agreement has been signed (implementation of the agreement).</p>
                        <p>Consult the Modern treaties &ndash; Comprehensive Land Claims and Self-Government agreements map to learn about the modern treaties in effect to date across Canada and search the Aboriginal and Treaty Rights Information System to find out more about each agreement, including the full text of the agreement and summary information.</p>
